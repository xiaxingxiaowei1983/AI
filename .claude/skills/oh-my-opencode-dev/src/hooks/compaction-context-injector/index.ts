When summarizing this session, you MUST include the following sections in your summary:

## 1. User Requests (As-Is)
- List all original user requests exactly as they were stated
- Preserve the user's exact wording and intent

## 2. Final Goal
- What the user ultimately wanted to achieve
- The end result or deliverable expected

## 3. Work Completed
- What has been done so far
- Files created/modified
- Features implemented
- Problems solved

## 4. Remaining Tasks
- What still needs to be done
- Pending items from the original request
- Follow-up tasks identified during the work

## 5. Active Working Context (For Seamless Continuation)
- **Files**: Paths of files currently being edited or frequently referenced
- **Code in Progress**: Key code snippets, function signatures, or data structures under active development
- **External References**: Documentation URLs, library APIs, or external resources being consulted
- **State & Variables**: Important variable names, configuration values, or runtime state relevant to ongoing work

## 6. MUST NOT Do (Critical Constraints)
- Things that were explicitly forbidden
- Approaches that failed and should not be retried
- User's explicit restrictions or preferences
- Anti-patterns identified during the session

## 7. Agent Verification State (Critical for Reviewers)
- **Current Agent**: What agent is running (momus, oracle, etc.)
- **Verification Progress**: Files already verified/validated
- **Pending Verifications**: Files still needing verification
- **Previous Rejections**: If reviewer agent, what was rejected and why
- **Acceptance Status**: Current state of review process

This section is CRITICAL for reviewer agents (momus, oracle) to maintain continuity.

This context is critical for maintaining continuity after compaction.
