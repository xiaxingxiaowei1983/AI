# OpenWork Architecture

## opencode primitives
how to pick the right extension abstraction for 
@opencode

opencode has a lot of extensibility options:
mcp / plugins / skills / bash / agents / commands

- mcp
use when you need authenticated third-party flows (oauth) and want to expose that safely to end users
good fit when "auth + capability surface" is the product boundary
downside: you're limited to whatever surface area the server exposes

- bash / raw cli
use only for the most advanced users or internal power workflows
highest risk, easiest to get out of hand (context creep + permission creep + footguns)
great for power users and prototyping, terrifying as a default for non-tech users

- plugins
use when you need real tools in code and want to scope permissions around them
good middle ground: safer than raw cli, more flexible than mcp, reusable and testable
basically "guardrails + capability packaging"

- skills
use when you want reliable plain-english patterns that shape behavior
best for repeatability and making workflows legible
pro tip: pair skills with plugins or cli (i literally embed skills inside plugins right now and expose commands like get_skills / retrieve)

- agents
use when you need to create tasks that are executed by different models than the main one and might have some extra context to find skills or interact with mcps.

- commands 
`/` commands that trigger tools

These are all opencode primitives you can read the docs to find out exactly how to set them up.

## Core Concepts of OpenWork

- uses all these primitives
- uses native OpenCode commands for reusable flows (markdown files in `.opencode/commands`)
- adds a new abstraction "workspace" is a project fodler and a simple .json file that includes a list of opencode primitives that map perfectly to an opencode workdir (not fully implemented)
  - openwork can open a workpace.json and decide where to populate a folder with thse settings (not implemented today

## Core Architecture

OpenWork is a Tauri application with two runtime modes:

### Mode A - Host (Desktop/Server)

- OpenWork runs on a desktop/laptop and **starts** OpenCode locally.
- The OpenCode server runs on loopback (default `127.0.0.1:4096`).
- OpenWork UI connects via the official SDK and listens to events.

### Mode B - Client (Desktop/Mobile)

- OpenWork runs on iOS/Android as a **remote controller**.
- It connects to an already-running OpenCode server hosted by a trusted device.
- Pairing uses a QR code / one-time token and a secure transport (LAN or tunneled).

This split makes mobile "first-class" without requiring the full engine to run on-device.

## OpenCode Integration (Exact SDK + APIs)

OpenWork uses the official JavaScript/TypeScript SDK:

- Package: `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2` (UI should import `@opencode-ai/sdk/v2/client` to avoid Node-only server code)
- Purpose: type-safe client generated from OpenAPI spec

### Engine Lifecycle

#### Start server + client (Host mode)

Use `createOpencode()` to launch the OpenCode server and create a client.

```ts
import { createOpencode } from "@opencode-ai/sdk/v2";

const opencode = await createOpencode({
  hostname: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 4096,
  timeout: 5000,
  config: {
    model: "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
  },
});

const { client } = opencode;
// opencode.server.url is available
```

#### Connect to an existing server (Client mode)

```ts
import { createOpencodeClient } from "@opencode-ai/sdk/v2/client";

const client = createOpencodeClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:4096",
  directory: "/path/to/project",
});
```

### Health + Version

- `client.global.health()`
  - Used for startup checks, compatibility warnings, and diagnostics.

### Event Streaming (Real-time UI)

OpenWork must be real-time. It subscribes to SSE events:

- `client.event.subscribe()`

The UI uses these events to drive:

- streaming assistant responses
- step-level tool execution timeline
- permission prompts
- session lifecycle changes

### Sessions (Primary Primitive)

OpenWork maps a "Task Run" to an OpenCode **Session**.

Core methods:

- `client.session.create()`
- `client.session.list()`
- `client.session.get()`
- `client.session.messages()`
- `client.session.prompt()`
- `client.session.abort()`
- `client.session.summarize()`

### Files + Search

OpenWork's file browser and "what changed" UI are powered by:

- `client.find.text()`
- `client.find.files()`
- `client.find.symbols()`
- `client.file.read()`
- `client.file.status()`

### Permissions

OpenWork must surface permission requests clearly and respond explicitly.

- Permission response API:
  - `client.permission.reply({ requestID, reply })` (where `reply` is `once` | `always` | `reject`)

OpenWork UI should:

1. Show what is being requested (scope + reason).
2. Provide choices (allow once / allow for session / deny).
3. Post the response to the server.
4. Record the decision in the run's audit log.

### Config + Providers

OpenWork's settings pages use:

- `client.config.get()`
- `client.config.providers()`
- `client.auth.set()` (optional flow to store keys)

### Extensibility - Skills + Plugins

OpenWork exposes two extension surfaces:

1. **Skills (OpenPackage)**
   - Installed into `.opencode/skills/*`.
   - OpenWork can run `opkg install` to pull packages from the registry or GitHub.

2. **Plugins (OpenCode)**
   - Plugins are configured via `opencode.json` in the workspace.
   - The format is the same as OpenCode CLI uses today.
   - OpenWork should show plugin status and instructions; a native plugin manager is planned.

### OpenPackage Registry (Current + Future)

- Today, OpenWork only supports **curated lists + manual sources**.
- Publishing to the official registry currently requires authentication (`opkg push` + `opkg configure`).
- Future goals:
  - in-app registry search
  - curated list sync (e.g. Awesome Claude Skills)
  - frictionless publishing without signup (pending registry changes)

## Projects + Path

- `client.project.list()` / `client.project.current()`
- `client.path.get()`

OpenWork conceptually treats "workspace" as the current project/path.

## Optional TUI Control (Advanced)

The SDK exposes `client.tui.*` methods. OpenWork can optionally provide a "Developer Mode" screen to:

- append/submit prompt
- open help/sessions/themes/models
- show toast

This is optional and not required for non-technical MVP.

## Folder Authorization Model

OpenWork enforces folder access through **two layers**:

1. **OpenWork UI authorization**
   - user explicitly selects allowed folders via native picker
   - OpenWork remembers allowed roots per profile

2. **OpenCode server permissions**
   - OpenCode requests permissions as needed
   - OpenWork intercepts requests via events and displays them

Rules:

- Default deny for anything outside allowed roots.
- "Allow once" never expands persistent scope.
- "Allow for session" applies only to the session ID.
- "Always allow" (if offered) must be explicit and reversible.

## Open Questions

- Best packaging strategy for Host mode engine (bundled vs user-installed Node/runtime).
- Best remote transport for mobile client (LAN only vs optional tunnel).
- Scheduling API surface (native in OpenCode server vs OpenWork-managed scheduler).
